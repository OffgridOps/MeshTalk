# MeshTalk 🚀🔐📡

**Quantum-Resistant, AI-Powered Offline Mesh Communication System**

MeshTalk is a decentralized, offline-capable voice and text communication platform designed for mission-critical, internet-free environments. It operates over WiFi/Bluetooth mesh networks using military-grade encryption and cutting-edge AI for real-time noise reduction and command recognition.

---

## 🌟 Features

- 📶 Offline Mesh Networking (via BATMAN-Adv over WiFi/Bluetooth)
- 🔐 Post-Quantum Encryption (CRYSTALS-Kyber + XChaCha20)
- 🧠 AI-Powered Noise Cancellation (RNNoise)
- 🗣️ Offline Voice Commands (via Vosk)
- 🌍 Flutter Frontend with walkie-talkie UI and mesh visualization
- ⚡ <100ms Voice Latency, fully peer-to-peer
- 🧱 Zero Central Servers, ephemeral identity, no phone numbers/IP logging
